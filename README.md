Course Registration System is software which is helpful for students as well as the University administration department. In the current system all the activities are done manually. It is very time consuming and costly. This registration System deals with the various activities related to the student course registration. 

In the System we can register as a user and user has of two types, student and administrator. Administrator has the power to add new user and can edit and delete a user. We can then do the course registration by the course number and calculate the total amounts due.
